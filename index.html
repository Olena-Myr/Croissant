      A <b>croissant</b> (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃]) is a buttery, flaky,
      viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
      <b>Austrian kipferl</b> but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
      dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough
      is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession,
      then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The
      process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.<i>
